        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Charles Gabriel G. Estrellado was born on January 5, 2004, in Sorsogon, Sorsogon City. Growing up in a family that prioritized education and hard work, he has always felt a deep sense of responsibility not only to achieve personal success but also to contribute positively to those around him. As the eldest son, brother, and a student, his life has been shaped by his roles in his family and his ambition to make a meaningful impact on society. From a young age, Charles was taught the importance of family. His parents instilled in him a deep respect for others, discipline, and compassion. As the middle child and the only boy among his siblings, he always felt a sense of duty to be a role model and guide for his other siblings. Growing up, he was often the one to assist, with household chores, or offer advice when needed. These responsibilities have strengthened his leadership and caring nature, qualities he continues to carry with him today. As a son, Charles learned that his actions reflect not only on himself but on his family as a whole. His parents made countless sacrifices to provide him and his siblings with a good education and a better life. Their constant support and love shaped him into the person he is today. Whether it was staying up late to help with school projects or offering words of encouragement during setbacks, his parents have played an essential role in his academic and personal growth. Being a brother has been equally impactful. The challenges and victories he experiences in his own journey often serve as lessons for them. Though conflicts arise from time to time, the bond between him and his siblings remains strong due to the love and respect they share. These relationships have taught Charles patience, empathy, and the significance of being present for loved ones. In school, Charles was always a curious and determined student. He excelled in subjects that required critical thinking and problem-solving, particularly in history and science. However, his pursuit of education was not solely about academic success; it was also about developing as a person. As he progressed through school, he began to see the value of education beyond the classroom it was about shaping his character and preparing him for the responsibilities of adulthood. During his high school years, Charles faced many challenges, such as balancing academics, friendships, and family expectations. At times, he struggled with self-doubt and felt overwhelmed by the pressure to succeed. However, he soon realized that these challenges were integral to his personal development. With guidance from his family and mentors, he learned to overcome obstacles and build resilience. Through these experiences, he discovered the importance of asking for help when needed, as well as the strength of the support provided by those around him. After high school, Charles decided to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Criminology. This decision was driven by his desire to make a meaningful impact on society and to contribute to maintaining peace and justice. He has always believed that personal growth should be coupled with a commitment to making a positive difference in the community. As a student of criminology, Charles is gaining the knowledge and skills necessary to pursue a career in law enforcement, with the ultimate goal of serving others and ensuring safer communities. The criminology program challenges him to think critically about justice, ethics, and the role of law in society, pushing him to grow both intellectually and personally. Being a criminology student is both rewarding and demanding. The coursework requires dedication, hard work, and a deep understanding of human behavior and the justice system. As Charles continues his studies, he remains constantly aware of the responsibility he holds not only to his family but also to society. Every day, he strives to be the best version of himself, motivated not only by his future career but by the people he cares about. The sacrifices made by his family and his own life experiences have shaped him into someone who values hard work, perseverance, and compassion. In the years ahead, Charles is determined to continue growing as a student, a son, and a brother. He is committed to pursuing a career in law enforcement to help make a positive difference in the world. The lessons he has learned from his family, his studies, and his personal experiences have equipped him with the tools needed to face the challenges ahead.
